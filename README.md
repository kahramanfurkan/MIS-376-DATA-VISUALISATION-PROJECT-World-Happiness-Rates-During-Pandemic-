# Change in Happiness Rates Worldwide During The Pandemic

### Part-A : Problem Description ###

*There is a report called "Happiness Report" which is accepted around the world. And this list includes the happiness rates in all countries of the world. The problem I want to address in this project is how the happiness rates have changed all over the world since the first quarter of 2020, the date of the Covid-19 outbreak. . How has Covid-19 affected people's happiness? In this project, we will examine the change in the pandemic process together with visuals and data.*

**Introduction :**

*Due to the Covid-19 epidemic, millions and even billions of people were imprisoned in their homes, could not go to work, students could not go to their schools and many sectors stopped working. As this is the case, people's hope levels, happiness levels and healthy life expectations have changed a lot. It is necessary to take a look at the data to better understand this global epidemic, which has caused all of them to decrease their happiness levels.*

**The Story of Problem :**
* In this study, I will primarily share the global happiness data between 2018 and 2021.
* Later, I will go a little more specific and deal with the year 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic process started, and the current 2021 data.
*	I will share with you the 5 happiest countries in the world and the 5 most unhappy countries with detailed data.
* I will refer to the data of Turkey, which is the part that concerns us, starting from 2018 and until 2021. In particular, I will refer to the decreasing happiness rate and "Healthy life expectancy" data during the pandemic process.
* I will also include the current happiness data of the people from the Turkish media, independently of the datasets, in this project.

### Part-B : Where does the data come from?

**The tool :**

**Data Sources :**

*I used the data of all the countries of the world in my project,thus I needed the data set. Most of the data sets were obtained from the "https://www.kaggle.com/" website. I prepared a few data sets manually.*

This dataset includes whole world’s happiness reports from 2015 to 2020.I used 2018 to 2020 :

Other datasets are attached in the project.I used 7 datasets totaly and and I have 8 visuals in my project.All files are available in the project documents.Live versions of graphs are available on **documents/live-graphs.md** path.

**What was challenging?**

*The most challenging part for me while completing my project was that I could not do what I wanted in the visualization tool. Due to the content of my project, I used data from all over the world and it would be really great to visualize on a world map. However, the visualization tool does not provide such a detailed service. Secondly, it belongs to Turkey. It was a bit difficult to find the data. Because the people who share their datasets publicly are mostly not Turkish, so if you want the data of Turkey, you should mostly do it manually by getting data from websites like "TÜİK".*
