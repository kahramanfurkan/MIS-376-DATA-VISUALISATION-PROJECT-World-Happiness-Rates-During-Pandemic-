# MIS-376-DATA-VISUALISATION-PROJECT
Project Theme: COVID-19

This project is prepared for the class MIS-376 Knowledge Mapping and Data Visualisation.It includes six parts of deliverables.

Deliverables:

A-Come to class prepared to provide orally a brief (2 -3 minute) description of the problem
you intend to address, the sources of the data, and any problems you foresee (just you
talking - no visual aids). Also, by noon on that day put the problem description posting on
your GitHub page.

B-Make an entry on your GitHub page describing the data you will require for your project.
Where are you getting it from, what challenges are you facing in preparing it, how much
data is it? How many files? (Due by noon on day of class).

C-Be prepared to give a rough run through of your project. It need not be completed, but the
final deliverable will benefit from class feedback.

D-Prepare a “slide” presentation of no more than 10 slides that tells your story - including
your five produced visuals (which you are encouraged to enhance with other tools).

E-Deliver a presentation to the class of that story using those slides.

Prepare and turn in, in addition to the slides, a written “article” presenting that same
story, as if for publication.

F-Also, prepare and turn in a 500-1,000 word description of the process you followed with
particular attention to the source of your data, how you obtained and cleaned it, any
challenges you had to overcome along the way, and the imagined audience that you have
prepared and tailored your presentation for, as well as any design choices you made given
your intended audience. Make it clear what your objective is: are you informing or are you
selling?
