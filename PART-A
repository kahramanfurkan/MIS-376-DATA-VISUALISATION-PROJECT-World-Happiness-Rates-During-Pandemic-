The problem I want to mention is the weekly death data in all of Turkey caused by the covid-19 epidemic.
I have dealt with especially the last 26 weeks in my project.
Most of the data I use comes from "https://covid19.saglik.gov.tr/", the government's website for covid-19 cases.
Apart from being sure about the accuracy of the data, I haven't encountered many problems.
