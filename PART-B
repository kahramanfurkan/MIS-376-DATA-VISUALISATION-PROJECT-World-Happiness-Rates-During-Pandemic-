Data I needed while preparing this project: The last 26 weeks data on the number of deaths across Turkey.
The size of the death data has not been overwhelming considering that I have covered the last 26 weeks (6 months).
The challenging part was choosing tools to visualize the data.Since I had to stay away from tools that require 
programming knowledge, I had to find an online web tool with mostly GUI.I included 5 visual graphs in my project, 
and my total graphile file count is 5.The sources from which I get the data are as follows:

*https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/turkey/
*https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/turkey
*https://www.coronatracker.com/country/turkey/
